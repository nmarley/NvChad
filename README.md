# nmarley NvChad

My fork of NvChad, b/c I don't want shit breaking b/c it's gitignored (lost my
configs once, mid 2023).

I also think NvChad kinda sucks (too many changes from defaults) but don't have
time to research alternatives so will keep my own changes (back) here and try to get back to a less customized, more default, bare state as I have time.
